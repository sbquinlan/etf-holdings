# ETF Holdings

This repository is a small collection of Typescript scripts that collect publicly available data from the ETF providers, collecting that data into a new dataset that describes the holdings of equity-backed, passive ETFs. 

There is no guarantee that the data provided is accurate and should not be used to without being validated. This tool is provided purely as an educational example.
